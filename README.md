Leetcode
==============
This project aims at solving [LeetCode algorithm problems] by using as a little library as I can. Coming up with different solutions and languages.
The first step is using pure C language to do so. 

I will keep updating and adding my work and new idea regularly. Hope it could help me to hunting work and pass the interview in the upcomming winter.
